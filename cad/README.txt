Notes from Ruza:

- The *.wire file is an Alias Design file.

- The *.dwg file is a standard CAD format --- just converted the *.wire file. 

- Other file formats are available just ping if you need a different one.

- these CAD files are made starting with the Soma *model*  -- off the model, not sculpture.
